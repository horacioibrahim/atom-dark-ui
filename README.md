# Lelleca UI Theme for Atom

A theme to girls and ladies for Atom.

We are accustomed with the black screen (or dark themes). But some things have changed and one of them is the positive influence of girls in the software development. To bring my daughter, I made a custom UI and Syntax themes for the Atom, my super lightweight development IDE!
